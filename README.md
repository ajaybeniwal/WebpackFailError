# WebpackFailError 
# Repository to reproduce the error with webpack dev server and webpack beta with sytemjs output build
# npm run start
# You will see failure message "Failed case no default export found"
# If we downgrade the webpack version to 4.43 we can see the correct default message exported from index.js "Webpack passed"
